1. Executive Summary

A privacy-preserving financial verification system that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a multi-device geolocation mesh. Unlike traditional expense trackers that rely solely on SMS parsing, this system validates transaction authenticity by cross-referencing banking notifications with real-time telemetry from a distributed network of authorized devices ("Trusted Mesh").

The core invention is the "Delegated Trust Protocol", which automatically verifies transactions made by family members or secondary users by validating their proximity to the merchant, resolving false-positive fraud alerts common in traditional hardware-bound security systems.

2. Problem Statement (Revised)

The "False Fraud" Paradox in Joint Finance

Rigid Location Security: Traditional banking apps use the primary user's GPS to detect fraud. If a spouse or sibling uses a secondary card at a grocery store while the primary user is at work, the transaction is flagged as a location mismatch.

Context Blindness: Standard SMS parsers cannot distinguish between an online transaction (where location is irrelevant) and a physical swipe (where location is critical).

Manual Reconciliation: Users must manually verify "delegated" expenses (spent by others), leading to accounting friction.

Market Gap

Existing solutions (Axio, MoneyView) focus on aggregation. They lack a hardware-integrated verification layer that can dynamically authorize transactions based on the presence of delegated trusted devices.

3. Proposed Solution & Architecture

3.1 Solution Overview

An intelligent system comprising:

Context-Aware NER: Distinguishes between Physical (POS/ATM) and Remote (Online/UPI) transactions.

Verification Mesh: A network of linked devices (Primary + Secondary users) sharing background telemetry.

Collaborative Arbiter: A backend logic that queries the entire mesh to validate physical proximity to a merchant.

4. Core Innovation: The "Delegated Trust" Protocol

4.1 Modality-First Analysis

The system first determines if hardware verification is necessary using the custom NER model.

Transaction Type

NER Indicators

Verification Protocol

Physical (POS)

POS, ATM, Retail, Store

Execute Mesh Query (Requires GPS Match)

Remote (CNP)

WWW, UPI, NetBanking

Skip Mesh Query (Verify via IP/Device ID)

4.2 The Mesh Query Logic (The Inventive Step)

Instead of checking Distance(Merchant, PrimaryUser) < Threshold, the system executes:

$$ \exists d \in D_{trusted} : Distance(Merchant, Location_d) < \tau $$

Where:

$D_{trusted}$ is the set of all authorized devices (User + Sister + Parents).

$\tau$ is the proximity threshold (e.g., 200 meters).

If any device in the mesh is near the merchant, the transaction is:

Verified automatically.

Attributed to the specific user present at the location (e.g., "Spent by Sister").

5. Novelty Claims (For Patent Filing)

5.1 Primary Independent Claim

"A system for collaborative financial context verification comprising a distributed network of mobile computing devices, wherein the validation of a transaction's geospatial authenticity is derived from the proximity of any single authorized device within the network to the transaction point-of-sale, regardless of the primary account holder's location."

5.2 Dependent Novel Features

Dynamic Modality Switching: The method of using Natural Language Processing (NER) to parse transaction notification strings specifically to categorize the "Physicality" of a transaction, thereby selectively activating hardware sensors only when necessary (saving battery and reducing false negatives).

Delegated Expense Attribution: The automatic tagging of financial records based on the device-ID that validated the transaction (e.g., auto-categorizing a purchase as "Family Expense" because the secondary device was present).

6. Technical Specifications (Revised)

6.1 Database Schema Additions

To support the Mesh, the database now includes:

-- The Trusted Mesh Network
CREATE TABLE trusted_devices (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    owner_id INTEGER,
    device_uuid TEXT UNIQUE,
    alias TEXT, -- e.g. "Sister"
    is_active BOOLEAN
);

-- Real-time Telemetry (Last Known Location)
CREATE TABLE mesh_telemetry (
    device_id INTEGER,
    lat REAL,
    lng REAL,
    accuracy REAL,
    timestamp DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY(device_id) REFERENCES trusted_devices(id)
);


6.2 API Endpoints for Mesh

Method

Endpoint

Description

POST

/mesh/register

Generate QR code to link a secondary device

POST

/mesh/telemetry

Background task endpoint for GPS updates

GET

/mesh/status

View active devices and their battery/location status

7. Prior Art Defense

How this differs from "Walnut" or "MoneyView":

Prior Art: Parses SMS to track what was spent.

This Invention: Uses SMS + Hardware Mesh to verify who spent it and if it is genuine.

Differentiation: Existing apps fail when a card is used by a family member (flagging it as a location mismatch or simply ignoring location). This system explicitly solves the "Shared Economy" use case via the Delegated Trust Protocol.

How this differs from Bank Fraud Detection:

Prior Art: Banks deny transactions if the card is used in a different city than the user's phone.

This Invention: Prevents false denials by proving that an authorized agent (the secondary device holder) was present at the point of sale.

8. Conclusion

By pivoting from a "Passive Tracker" to an "Active Verification Mesh," this project now qualifies as a technical invention involving hardware-software integration. It addresses a specific technical failure in current fraud detection systems (the false-positive rejection of delegated transactions) using a novel multi-device triangulation method.
